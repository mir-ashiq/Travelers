# Guest Checkout Implementation - Phase 1 Update

## Overview

The payment flow has been redesigned to allow **guests to browse and book without registration**. Customers only need to authenticate when they proceed to payment.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. **Booking Creation** (Public - No Auth Required)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/bookings`

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "package_id": 1,
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "customer_email": "john@example.com",
  "customer_phone": "+1234567890",
  "travel_date": "2025-12-20",
  "number_of_guests": 2,
  "special_requests": "Extra pillow, wheelchair accessible room"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": {
    "id": 123,
    "package_id": 1,
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "customer_email": "john@example.com",
    "amount": 4000,
    "status": "Pending",
    "payment_status": "Pending",
    "created_at": "2025-10-26T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "message": "Booking created successfully. Proceed to payment."
}
```

**Features**:

- ✅ No authentication required
- ✅ Automatically calculates total price (price_per_person × number_of_guests)
- ✅ Creates pending booking record
- ✅ Returns booking ID for payment processing

### 2. **Payment Page - Enhanced Flow**

**New Component**: `GuestPaymentPage.tsx`

**Three-Step Checkout Process**:

#### Step 1: Authentication

User chooses:

- **Existing Customer**: Login with email/password
- **New Customer**: Proceed as guest (no account creation required)

For guest checkout, collects:

- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number

#### Step 2: Billing Address

Collects complete billing information:

- Full name
- Email
- Phone
- Street address
- City
- State
- ZIP code
- Country

#### Step 3: Payment

- Stripe card form
- Secure processing
- Success confirmation

**Features**:

- ✅ Multi-step form (cleaner UX)
- ✅ Login OR guest checkout option
- ✅ Auto-login for registered customers
- ✅ Persistent billing information
- ✅ Form validation at each step
- ✅ Back/Continue buttons for navigation
- ✅ Order summary sidebar
- ✅ Success confirmation with auto-redirect

### 3. **Backend Changes**

#### Bookings Route (`/backend/routes/bookings.js`)

**New Public Endpoints**:

1. `POST /api/bookings` - Create booking (public, no auth)
2. `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Get booking details (public, no auth)

**Admin-Only Endpoints** (existing):

- `POST /api/bookings/assign` - Assign booking to agent
- `POST /api/bookings/update-payment` - Update payment status
- `POST /api/bookings/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple bookings
- `GET /api/bookings` - List all bookings (with permission check)
- `PATCH /api/bookings/:id` - Update booking
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` - Delete booking

### 4. **Frontend Changes**

#### AppRoutes.tsx

- ✅ Replaced `PaymentPage` with `GuestPaymentPage`
- ✅ Removed `ProtectedRoute` wrapper from `/payment/:bookingId`
- ✅ Payment page now accessible to all users (authenticated or guest)

#### GuestPaymentPage.tsx (NEW)

- 450+ lines of new code
- Multi-step form handling
- Guest checkout support
- Existing customer login
- Form validation
- Stripe integration
- Success confirmation

## User Flow Comparison

### Before (Old Flow)

```
Browse → Create Account → Verify Email → Login → Dashboard → Book Package → Payment
```

**Issue**: Users had to register before booking

### After (New Flow - GUEST)

```
Browse → Book Package → Payment → (Optional: Create Account OR Continue as Guest)
```

### After (New Flow - EXISTING CUSTOMER)

```
Browse → Book Package → Payment → Login → Proceed with Payment
```

## Database Schema Changes

### Bookings Table

The existing bookings table now supports guest checkouts:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  package_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES packages(id),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),  -- Optional for guests
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  customer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  customer_phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  travel_date DATE NOT NULL,
  number_of_guests INTEGER NOT NULL,
  special_requests TEXT,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
  payment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
  assigned_to UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Key Points**:

- `customer_id` is NULL for guest bookings
- `customer_email` and `customer_phone` work for both guests and customers
- `amount` is pre-calculated during booking creation

## Security Considerations

✅ **Guest Checkout Security**:

- No sensitive data stored before payment
- Email verification done by Stripe
- Phone number validated during checkout
- Address verification at payment time
- All forms are server-validated

✅ **Database Security**:

- RLS policies handle both guest and authenticated access
- Guest bookings marked with NULL customer_id
- Email uniqueness not required (guests can use same email)
- Audit logging for all transactions

✅ **Payment Security**:

- Stripe handles all card processing
- PCI compliance through Stripe
- Payment intent created server-side
- Webhook verification for payment status

## API Reference

### Create Booking

```
POST /api/bookings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "package_id": 1,
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "customer_email": "john@example.com",
  "customer_phone": "+1234567890",
  "travel_date": "2025-12-20",
  "number_of_guests": 2,
  "special_requests": "Optional notes"
}

Response: 201 Created
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": { ... }
}
```

### Get Booking Details

```

Response: 200 OK
{
  "booking": { ... }
}
```

### Create Payment Intent (Requires Booking ID)

```
POST /api/payments/create-payment-intent
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer [optional JWT token]

{
  "bookingId": 123,
  "amount": 4000,
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "zipCode": "10001",
  "country": "US"
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "clientSecret": "pi_xxx#secret_xxx",
  "stripeCustomerId": "cus_xxx",
  "transactionId": 456,
  "amount": 4000,
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

## Migration Path for Existing Bookings

If you have existing bookings created before this update:

1. Bookings with customer_id will continue to work
2. New guest bookings will have customer_id = NULL
3. Admin dashboard shows both guest and customer bookings
4. Email communication works for both

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for Phase 2:

- [ ] Guest account creation after payment (one-click registration)
- [ ] Social login (Google, Facebook) for faster checkout
- [ ] Payment method storage for returning guests
- [ ] One-click checkout for repeat bookings
- [ ] Gift cards / Promotional codes
- [ ] Split payments / Installments
- [ ] Email receipt with booking details
- [ ] SMS notifications for booking updates

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Booking not found" on payment page

**Solution**: Ensure booking ID is correct and booking was created successfully

### Issue: Payment intent fails to create

**Solution**: Check that all required fields are provided in request

### Issue: Guest doesn't receive confirmation email

**Solution**: Verify SMTP settings in .env and check email service logs

### Issue: Stripe card validation fails

**Solution**: Use test cards: 4242 4242 4242 4242 (success), 4000 0000 0000 0002 (decline)

## Files Modified

1. **Frontend**:

   - `/website/src/pages/GuestPaymentPage.tsx` (NEW - 450+ lines)
   - `/website/src/AppRoutes.tsx` (Updated imports and routes)

2. **Backend**:
   - `/backend/routes/bookings.js` (Added public endpoints)
   - `/backend/routes/payments.js` (Fixed Supabase imports)
   - `/backend/routes/customers.js` (Fixed Supabase imports)

## Deployment Notes

1. **No database migration required** - Existing schema supports guest bookings
2. **No breaking changes** - Existing customer functionality unchanged
3. **Backward compatible** - Old payment flow still works for authenticated users
4. **Environment variables** - No new variables needed
