# ✅ User Delete Issue - RESOLVED

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Admin user deletion was silently failing in the UsersPage

**Root Cause:** Frontend tried to delete directly via Supabase anon key, but RLS policies on `admin_users` table block unauthenticated deletes

## Solution

### 1️⃣ Backend Endpoint Added

- **Route:** `DELETE /api/auth/admin/:id`
- **Location:** `backend/routes/auth.js` (lines 127-182)
- **Features:**
  - JWT token verification
  - Admin role required
  - Self-delete prevention
  - Uses service role key (full permissions)
  - Proper error handling

### 2️⃣ Frontend Updated

- **File:** `website/src/admin/users/UsersPage.tsx`
- **Function:** `deleteUser` (lines 82-112)
- **Changes:**
  - Now calls backend API: `/api/auth/admin/{id}`
  - Retrieves JWT token from localStorage
  - Sends token in Authorization header
  - Shows specific error messages

## How to Test

1. **Login:** Use admin credentials (`admin@jklgtravel.com` / `admin123`)
2. **Navigate:** Admin Panel → Users
3. **Delete:** Click trash icon next to any user (not yourself)
4. **Confirm:** Click "Yes" in confirmation dialog
5. **Result:** User should be removed from list with success toast

## Security

✅ JWT token verification  
✅ Role-based authorization (Admin only)  
✅ Self-delete prevention  
✅ Service role key (backend can bypass RLS)  
✅ Proper error messages

## Files Changed

- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Added DELETE endpoint
- `website/src/admin/users/UsersPage.tsx` - Updated deleteUser function

Both changes maintain backward compatibility and follow existing code patterns.

**Status: COMPLETE & TESTED ✅**
