## 🔄 Updating Destinations via Database

If you prefer SQL:

```sql
-- Update a destination
UPDATE destinations
SET
  altitude = 2650,
  best_season = 'June to September',
  distance = 84,
  attractions = ARRAY['Gondola', 'Lake', 'Meadow'],
  activities = ARRAY['Skiing', 'Hiking'],
  latitude = 34.2657,
  longitude = 75.4857,
  average_temperature = '-5°C to 5°C',
  accommodation = '5-star resort',
  difficulty = 'Moderate',
  best_for = ARRAY['Families', 'Adventure Seekers']
WHERE name = 'Gulmarg';
```

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Best Practices

✅ Keep attraction names short (2-3 words)  
✅ Use consistent activity names  
✅ Be realistic about difficulty levels  
✅ Include 4-8 items in arrays  
✅ Use temperature format: "X°C to Y°C"

### Examples

- Good: "Gondola Ride", not "You can ride the gondola up and down the mountain"
- Good: "15°C to 25°C", not "cool and pleasant"
- Good: "Moderate", not "medium-hard-ish"

**Question**: Can't find coordinate values?  
**Answer**: Use Google Maps to find latitude/longitude, or approximations work fine.

**Question**: What if I leave fields blank?  
**Answer**: Optional fields (marked with `?`) won't display on the website. That's fine!

**Question**: How do I delete a destination?  
**Answer**: Ask your admin or database admin to handle this.
