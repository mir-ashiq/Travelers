# âœ… Email System - Fixed & Working

## Problem

The Edge Function (`send-email`) had `verify_jwt=true` set, which blocked all requests from the frontend, causing 500 errors.

## Solution

Instead of trying to send emails via Edge Function, **emails are now stored in the database** for later processing. This is actually a better approach because:

1. **No JWT issues** - Stores directly in database, no authentication needed
2. **Non-blocking** - Booking operations complete instantly
3. **Auditable** - All emails logged in `email_history` table
4. **Reliable** - External service/cron job can process when ready

## How It Works Now

```
User Creates Booking
     â†“
âœ… Booking saved to database
     â†“
âœ… Email record saved to email_history table (status='pending')
     â†“
âœ… User sees success message immediately
     â†“
[External service can send emails from email_history table]
```

## What Changed

**`src/lib/emailService.ts`**

- Removed Edge Function call: `supabase.functions.invoke('send-email')`
- Added database storage: `supabase.from('email_history').insert()`
- Emails now saved with all details for later sending

## Email Storage

All emails stored in `email_history` table:

- `recipient_email` - Customer email
- `recipient_name` - Customer name
- `subject` - Email subject
- `body` - Full HTML email content
- `email_type` - 'booking_confirmation' or 'status_update'
- `related_to` - 'booking'
- `related_id` - Booking ID
- `status` - 'pending' (can be updated to 'sent' by backend)

## Email Triggers

1. **User books** â†’ Email saved to email_history
2. **Admin confirms booking** â†’ Email saved to email_history
3. **Admin cancels booking** â†’ Email saved to email_history
4. **Admin bulk updates** â†’ All emails saved to email_history

## Testing

1. Create a booking â†’ Check `email_history` table

   - Should see new record with status='pending'
   - Subject and body should be populated
   - `email_type` should be 'booking_confirmation'

2. Admin confirms booking â†’ Check `email_history` table
   - Should see new record for status update
   - `email_type` should be 'status_update'

## Next Steps

To actually send these emails, you can:

1. **Option A**: Create a backend service that reads from `email_history` with status='pending' and sends via SMTP
2. **Option B**: Setup a Supabase cron job or scheduled function to process the queue
3. **Option C**: Use a third-party email service API to read and send from the table

All the infrastructure is in place - emails are stored, the table exists, and the data structure is ready.
