```javascript
POST /api/bookings

Request:

  "package_id": 1,
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "customer_email": "john@example.com",
  "customer_phone": "+1-555-0000",
  "travel_date": "2025-12-20",
  "number_of_guests": 2
}

Response: 201 Created
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": {
    "id": 123,
    "package_id": 1,
    "amount": 4000,
    "status": "Pending"
  }
}
```

**2. Get Booking Details (No Authentication)**

```javascript
GET /api/bookings/:id

Response: 200 OK
{
  "booking": { /* booking details */ }
}
```

### Frontend: 3-Step Payment Form

```

```
Browse → Book → Pay (as guest, no registration)
              → No friction!
```

### After (Customer Path) ✅

```
Browse → Book → Pay → Login (optional) → Success
              (login only at payment)
```
