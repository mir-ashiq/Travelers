# 🔧 Email Duplicate Fix - October 26, 2025

## Problem Identified

Emails were being sent **2 times** because:

1. The email service processes all `pending` emails every 30 seconds
2. If the database update marking an email as `sent` was delayed or failed
3. The next cycle would pick up the same email and send it again
4. If the service crashed during processing, emails would remain `pending` and be retried

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Lock Mechanism (Atomic Status)**

Added a **state transition** approach using an intermediate `processing` status:

```javascript
// Before sending, mark email as 'processing'
await supabase
  .from("email_history")
  .update({ status: "processing" })
  .eq("id", email.id)
  .eq("status", "pending"); // Only update if still pending
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Prevents duplicate sends within the same cycle
- ✅ Atomic operation - only one process can claim an email
- ✅ Clear visibility into which emails are currently being processed

### 2. **Error Recovery**

If email sending fails after marking as `processing`:

```javascript
if (updateError) {
  // Reset back to 'pending' so it can be retried
  await supabase
    .from("email_history")
    .update({ status: "pending" })
    .eq("id", emailRecord.id);
  return false;
}
```

### 3. **Abandoned Email Cleanup**

New function runs every 30 seconds before processing:

```javascript
// If email stuck in 'processing' for > 5 minutes (crashed process)
// Reset it back to 'pending' for retry
```

**Scenario:** Service crashes while sending - emails don't get stuck forever

## Email Status Flow

```
pending (new email)
  ↓
processing (being sent right now)
  ↓
sent ✅ (success)

OR

pending → processing → failed ❌ (retry later)

OR

pending → processing → pending (timeout > 5 min, auto-reset)
```

---

## Changes Made

**File:** `backend/email-sender.js`

### Updated Functions:

**1. `processPendingEmails()`**

- ✅ Marks emails as `processing` before sending
- ✅ Only processes if status is `pending` (atomic)
- ✅ Calls cleanup function first each cycle

**2. `sendEmail()`**

- ✅ Resets to `pending` if update fails
- ✅ Better error recovery

**3. `cleanupAbandonedEmails()` (NEW)**

- ✅ Finds emails stuck in `processing` > 5 minutes
- ✅ Resets them back to `pending` for retry
- ✅ Runs before each email processing cycle

**4. `main()`**

- ✅ Calls `cleanupAbandonedEmails()` on startup
- ✅ Calls cleanup in scheduled interval loop

## Email Status Enum

Required in database `email_history` table:

```sql
-- Current statuses (need to check if 'processing' exists)
status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'sent', 'failed'))
```

If `processing` status doesn't exist in your database, add it:

```sql
ALTER TABLE email_history ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status_with_processing
VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status_with_processing IN ('pending', 'processing', 'sent', 'failed'));

-- Or update existing constraint
ALTER TABLE email_history DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS email_history_status_check;
ALTER TABLE email_history ADD CONSTRAINT email_history_status_check
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'sent', 'failed'));
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Normal Processing

1. Create a new booking (email inserted as `pending`)
2. Watch email service process it
3. Status should change: `pending` → `processing` → `sent`
4. ✅ Email should NOT be sent twice

### Test 2: Service Crash Recovery

1. Restart the email service while processing
2. Previously `processing` emails (> 5 min old) reset to `pending`
3. Service retries them
4. ✅ No data loss, no duplicates

### Test 3: Multiple Pending Emails

1. Create 5 bookings rapidly (all `pending`)
2. Service should process ALL without duplicating
3. ✅ Each sent exactly once

---

## Monitoring

Check email status in database:

```sql
SELECT id, recipient_email, status, created_at, sent_at
FROM email_history
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Expected Status Distribution:

- `pending` - Waiting to send (should decrease)
- `processing` - Currently sending (should be 0-1 normally)
- `sent` - Successfully sent ✅
- `failed` - Failed to send (check error_message)

---

## Performance Notes

✅ **Efficient:**

- Uses database constraints for atomicity (no race conditions)
- Minimal extra queries
- Same 30-second interval as before

✅ **Reliable:**

- Automatic recovery from crashes
- Cleanup runs every cycle
- Never loses emails

✅ **Observable:**

- Can track which emails are being processed
- Clear status transitions in logs
- Error messages for debugging

---

## Restart Required

After applying this fix:

1. Stop current backend: `Ctrl+C`
2. Update `backend/email-sender.js` with new code ✅
3. Restart: `node server.js` or `npm start`
4. Email service will auto-start with new logic
