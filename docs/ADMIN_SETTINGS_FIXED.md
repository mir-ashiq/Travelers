# Admin Settings - Troubleshooting & Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

The admin panel settings (logo upload and general settings) were not working due to:

1. **Missing API endpoint** - The frontend was directly accessing Supabase instead of going through the backend API
2. **No logo upload functionality** - Logo upload button was non-functional with no backend handler
3. **Direct Supabase calls** - Security issue with direct Supabase access from frontend

## üîß Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. ‚úÖ Created `/backend/routes/settings.js` with complete CRUD endpoints:

   - `GET /api/settings` - Get all settings
   - `GET /api/settings/:key` - Get specific setting
   - `POST /api/settings` - Save/update settings
   - `PUT /api/settings/:key` - Update single setting
   - `POST /api/settings/logo` - Upload logo (file upload)
   - `DELETE /api/settings/logo` - Delete logo

2. ‚úÖ Updated `backend/server.js` to register the settings route

3. ‚úÖ Added `multer` dependency to `backend/package.json` for file uploads

### Frontend Changes

1. ‚úÖ Updated `website/src/admin/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` to:

   - Use API endpoints instead of direct Supabase calls
   - Added `handleLogoUpload()` function for file upload
   - Added `handleDeleteLogo()` function to delete logo
   - Updated UI with functional upload/delete buttons

2. ‚úÖ Logo state management with `logoUrl` and `isUploadingLogo`

3. ‚úÖ All settings now saved through the unified API endpoint

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket (One-time setup)

You need to create a `site-assets` bucket in Supabase storage. Do this via:

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Click "New Bucket"
3. Name: `site-assets`
4. Leave as Private (recommended)
5. Click "Create Bucket"

**Option B: Via SQL**
Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('site-assets', 'site-assets', false)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Set bucket policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'site-assets' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public to read logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'site-assets');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'site-assets' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Make sure these exist in your `.env` files:

**Backend (.env):**

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

**Frontend (.env):**

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
# For production: https://yourdomain.com/api
```

### Step 3: Restart Services

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm install  # Already done
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend (in new terminal)
cd website
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Admin Settings

1. Open admin panel: http://localhost:5173/admin (or your dev URL)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí General Settings
3. Test each feature:
   - ‚úÖ Upload logo (should show preview)
   - ‚úÖ Edit company name
   - ‚úÖ Add/remove emails and phones
   - ‚úÖ Edit office address
   - ‚úÖ Save all settings
   - ‚úÖ Refresh page - settings should persist
   - ‚úÖ Logo should appear in footer

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to load settings"

**Solution**:

- Check backend is running (`npm start`)
- Check `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify backend route is registered in `server.js`

### Issue: "Logo upload fails"

**Solution**:

- Check if `site-assets` bucket exists in Supabase storage
- Check file size is < 5MB
- Check file format is supported (jpg, png, gif, webp)
- Check Supabase storage policies allow uploads
- Check network tab in browser dev tools

### Issue: "Settings don't save"

**Solution**:

- Check backend API is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection credentials
- Check `site_settings` table exists in database

### Issue: "Multer not found"

**Solution**:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Logo files** are stored in Supabase Storage (not in database)
2. **File upload** has validation:
   - Max size: 5MB
   - Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
   - Checked on both client and server
3. **All data** goes through authenticated backend API
4. **Storage bucket** is private by default
5. **Public access** only for read operations

## üìû Need Help?

If settings still don't work:

1. Check all files were updated correctly
2. Verify backend is running and settings route is registered
3. Check browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab for API calls
4. Check browser DevTools ‚Üí Console for errors
5. Check backend console for error messages
