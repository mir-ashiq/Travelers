## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: SQL fails to run

**Solution:** Try alternative SQL in `SUPABASE_SQL_COPY_PASTE.md`

- [ ] Check SQL syntax (commas, quotes)
- [ ] Reload page and try again
- [ ] Check Supabase status page

### Problem: Still getting 2 emails

**Solution:** Database constraint not updated

- [ ] Verify SQL ran (check Step 1)
- [ ] Run SQL again
- [ ] Check status column allows 'processing'
- [ ] Restart backend

### Problem: Backend won't start

**Solution:** Check logs

- [ ] Stop process (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Check .env file exists
- [ ] Check port 3000 not in use
- [ ] Try: `node server.js 2>&1 | tee logs.txt`

### Problem: Email not sending

**Solution:** SMTP issue

- [ ] Check SMTP credentials in .env
- [ ] Verify email_history table exists
- [ ] Check database constraint
- [ ] Check backend SMTP logs

## 📋 POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

Run these checks to confirm success:

### 1. Database Check

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
SELECT check_clause FROM information_schema.check_constraints
WHERE table_name = 'email_history';
```

**Expected:** `status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'sent', 'failed')`

### 2. Email Check

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total, status
FROM email_history
GROUP BY status;
```

**Expected:**

- `pending`: 0-1 (processing)
- `processing`: 0-1 (currently sending)
- `sent`: 10+ (all your test emails)
- `failed`: 0 (ideally)

### 3. Backend Check

**Look for in logs:**

- ✅ Email service started
- ✅ SMTP connection verified
- ✅ Processing emails every 30 seconds
- ✅ Status transitions: pending → processing → sent

### 4. Functional Check

- ✅ Create booking → Check email sent once
- ✅ Check logs show correct status
- ✅ No duplicates in inbox
- ✅ Email received within 30 seconds

## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE FIX

**The Problem:**

- Email service processes all `pending` emails
- If status update delayed → email still `pending`
- Next cycle sends same email again
- Result: Duplicate emails ❌

**The Solution:**

- Lock email: `pending` → `processing` (atomic)
- Send email
- Mark complete: `processing` → `sent`
- Next cycle: Only finds `pending` (no duplicates)
- Result: Each email sent exactly once ✅

**The Bonus:**

- If email stuck in `processing` > 5 min
- Auto-cleanup resets it: `processing` → `pending`
- Next cycle retries (no data loss)
