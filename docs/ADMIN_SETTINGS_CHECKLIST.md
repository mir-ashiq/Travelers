npm start

# Terminal 2 - Test API (in PowerShell)
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/settings" -Method GET
$response.StatusCode  # Should be 200
$response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json  # Should show settings
```

### Storage Bucket Check

1. Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Should see `site-assets` bucket
3. Upload logo via admin
4. Should appear in `site-assets/logos/` folder

### Database Check

   ```sql
   SELECT key, value FROM site_settings LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. Should see settings with updated values
