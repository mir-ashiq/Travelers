## 🎯 Quick Start (Choose One)

### Option 1: Manual Separation (If you want to learn)

1. Read: `FILE_ORGANIZATION_SEPARATED.md`
2. Copy files to proper folders
3. Test locally
4. Deploy

### Option 2: Automatic (I'll do it)

Just say "organize files" and I'll:

- Move all files to proper folders
- Update all imports
- Test everything
- Ready to deploy

---

## 📂 Current Files to Move

### TO `website/` folder

```
✓ src/                    (all React code)
✓ vite.config.ts
✓ tsconfig.json
✓ tailwind.config.js
✓ package.json
✓ index.html
✓ .env.example
✓ postcss.config.js
```

### TO `backend/` folder

```
✓ server.js
✓ email-sender.js
✓ start-dev-with-emails.js
✓ package.json (backend version)
✓ .env.example
```

### KEEP in root

```
✓ .gitignore
✓ README.md
✓ All documentation files
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Organize Files (if not automated)

```bash
# Follow FILE_ORGANIZATION_SEPARATED.md
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

```bash
cd backend
# Push to GitHub
# Railway auto-deploys
# Get URL: your-backend.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Deploy Website to Vercel

```bash
cd website
# Set VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app
# Push to GitHub
# Vercel auto-deploys
# Get URL: your-project.vercel.app
```

### Step 4: Test

```bash
1. Visit website: https://your-project.vercel.app
2. Create booking
3. Check email (should arrive in 30 seconds)
4. Success! ✅
```
