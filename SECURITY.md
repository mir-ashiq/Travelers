## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Authentication**

   - Never commit credentials
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement JWT token refresh
   - Log security-relevant events

2. **Data Protection**

   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
   - Use HTTPS only in production
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Never log passwords or tokens

3. **Access Control**

   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Check authorization on backend
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Review permissions regularly

4. **Dependencies**

   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Use `npm audit fix` for vulnerabilities
   - Use exact versions for critical dependencies

5. **Code Review**
   - Require peer review for security-related changes
   - Use automated security scanning
   - Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

### For Administrators

1. **Access Control**

   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Limit admin access to necessary personnel
   - Review user permissions quarterly

2. **Monitoring**

   - Monitor login attempts
   - Track admin actions
   - Alert on suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits

3. **Maintenance**

   - Keep systems and dependencies updated
   - Backup data regularly
   - Test backup restoration
   - Document security procedures
