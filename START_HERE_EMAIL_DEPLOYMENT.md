## 🚀 To Send Your First Email (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies (1 minute)

```powershell
npm install nodemailer @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 2. Create `.env` File (2 minutes)

Create a new file named `.env` in your project root with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ynqceffvnagwrbchnyls.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
SMTP_HOST=mail.abctravels.site
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@abctravels.site
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_email_password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@abctravels.site
```

**Critical**: Get Service Role Key from:

- Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API → "Service role key" (NOT anon key)

### 3. Run Email Sender (1 minute)

```powershell
node email-sender.js
```

**Expected output:**

```
📧 Processing pending emails...
✅ Email sent: <message_id>
Updated email_history ID 3 to sent status
```

### 4. Verify (1 minute)

- Check email inbox for booking confirmation
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM email_history WHERE id=3`
  - Status should be: `sent`
  - message_id should be populated

**Done! ✅**

## 📧 How It Works

```
User Books
   ↓
Frontend Queues Email to Database
   ↓
User sees "Booking Created!" immediately (no wait)
   ↓
Email sits in database with status='pending'
   ↓
You run: node email-sender.js
   ↓
Service reads pending emails
   ↓
Service sends via SMTP
   ↓
Database updated: status='sent'
   ↓
Email delivered to customer inbox
```

## ✅ Current Test Data Ready to Send

**In your email_history table:**

- Email ID: 3
- Recipient: imseldrith@gmail.com
- Subject: "Booking Confirmation - Ladakh Adventure: 8 Days Tour"
- Status: **pending** (waiting to be sent)
- Created: When booking was made
- Will be sent: When you run `node email-sender.js`

This email is **ready to send right now**.

## 🔄 Keep Running 24/7

After sending your first email successfully, choose how to keep the service running:

### Option 1: PM2 (Recommended)

```powershell
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start email-sender.js --name "email-sender"
pm2 startup          # Auto-start on reboot
pm2 save             # Save configuration
pm2 logs email-sender  # View logs anytime
```

### Option 2: Windows Task Scheduler

See `EMAIL_SENDER_SETUP.md` for step-by-step instructions

### Option 3: Just Keep Terminal Open

```powershell
node email-sender.js
```

Leaves terminal window open and keeps service running

### Option 4: Cron Job (Linux/Mac)

```bash
*/5 * * * * node /path/to/email-sender.js
```

5. Run `node email-sender.js`
6. Email should arrive in inbox ✅

### Test 2: Admin Status Update Creates Email

1. Go to Admin → Bookings
2. Select a booking
3. Change status to "Confirmed"
