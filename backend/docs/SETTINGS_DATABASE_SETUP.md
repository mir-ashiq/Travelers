# ✅ Settings Database Integration Complete

## What Was Created

### 1. **Database Table** (`site_settings`)

✅ Created in Supabase with:

- 5 setting keys (general, social, display, hero, email)
- JSONB storage for flexible data
- RLS policies for public read + authenticated write
- Auto-timestamp tracking

### 2. **Updated Settings Component**

✅ Enhanced `SettingsPage.tsx` with:

- Auto-load settings from database on mount
- Save all settings to database with one click
- Loading spinner while fetching
- Success/error feedback messages
- Disabled save button during save operation

### 3. **Documentation**

✅ Created `DATABASE_SETTINGS_SCHEMA.md` with:

- Complete table schema
- All data structures (JSON examples)
- RLS policies explained
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide

---

## What Gets Saved Now

When you click **"Save Changes"**, these are persisted to the database:

1. **General Settings** (Company name, email, phone, address)
2. **Hero Carousel Slides** (All 3 slides with images)
3. **Social Media Links** (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube)
4. **Display Settings** (Your sliders: brightness, opacity, animation)
5. **Email Templates** (Booking confirmation, welcome, etc.)

---

## How It Works

### Load Flow:

```
Page Mount → Load from Database → Populate Form → Display UI
```

### Save Flow:

```
Click Save → Validate → Send to DB → Show Success → Auto-clear
```

### Data Storage:

```
React State (UI) ↔ Supabase DB (Persistent)
```

---

## Testing It

### 1. **View Current Settings**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT key, value FROM site_settings;
```

### 2. **Try Saving**

- Go to Admin → Settings
- Modify any field (e.g., Site Name)
- Click "Save Changes"
- See green success message
- Refresh page → value should persist

### 3. **Check Database**

```sql
-- Should show your updated value
SELECT value FROM site_settings WHERE key = 'general_settings';
```

## Next: Frontend Application

To actually **apply** these settings across the app:

1. Create a `SettingsContext` to share settings globally
2. Load settings once at app startup
3. Use in components:
   - Apply brightness filter to hero section
   - Apply opacity to feature cards
   - Apply animation speed globally
   - Use social links in footer
   - Use company info in header/footer

Example:

```typescript
// In HomePage
const { displaySettings } = useSettings();
return (
  <section style={{ filter: `brightness(${displaySettings.heroBrightness}%)` }}>
    {/* Hero content */}
  </section>
);
```

---

## Database Queries

View all settings:

```sql
SELECT * FROM site_settings;
```

Get one setting:

```sql
SELECT value FROM site_settings WHERE key = 'display_settings';
```

Update directly:

```sql
UPDATE site_settings
SET value = '{"heroBrightness":80,"featureOpacity":90,"animationSpeed":60}'::jsonb
WHERE key = 'display_settings';
```
