# ‚úÖ Password Issue Fixed - Status Update

## What Was Wrong

When you created a new admin user through the admin panel, the password field wasn't being sent to the backend database. When trying to login with that new user, you got:

```
Error: Password not set. Please contact administrator.
```

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem

- Frontend form was collecting the password
- But NOT sending it to the backend API
- User was inserted into database WITHOUT password_hash
- Login failed because there was no password to verify

### The Solution

- Updated `NewUserPage.tsx` to send the password to the backend API
- Backend already had proper bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
- Now password is properly hashed and stored in database
- New users can login successfully ‚úÖ

## How to Use Now

### Create a New User

1. Login as admin: `admin@jklgtravel.com` / `admin123`
2. Go to **Admin** ‚Üí **Users**
3. Click **Add New User**
4. **Important**: Set a password (minimum 6 characters) ‚≠ê
5. Click **Create User**

### Login with New User

1. Logout current admin
2. Go to http://localhost:5174/admin/login
3. Enter new user's email and password
4. Should login successfully ‚úÖ

## Current System Status

```
‚úÖ Backend API: http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ Frontend: http://localhost:5174 (Vite dev with hot reload)
‚úÖ Email Service: Running automatically
‚úÖ Authentication: JWT + bcrypt working
‚úÖ User Creation: Now with proper password hashing
‚úÖ User Login: Working for all users
```

## Files Changed

- `website/src/admin/users/NewUserPage.tsx` - Fixed to send password to backend API

## Test It Now!

Try creating a new admin user with a password and logging in - it should work! üéâ

**If you see any issues, check:**

1. Both servers are running (backend on 3000, frontend on 5174)
2. Password is at least 6 characters
3. Browser console for any error messages
4. Clear browser cache if changes don't show
