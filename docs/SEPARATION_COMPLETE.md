## ⚡ Ready to Go!

You can now:

1. Deploy website to **Vercel** independently
2. Deploy backend to **Railway** independently
3. Update either one without affecting the other
4. Scale each platform separately
5. Reduce costs by using Vercel free tier + Railway $5/mo

**Total monthly cost: $5-10** 💰
