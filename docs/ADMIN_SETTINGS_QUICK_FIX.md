# 🎉 Admin Settings - FIXED!

## The Problem

Admin panel settings (logo upload and other settings) were not working because:

- ❌ Frontend was directly calling Supabase (bypassing API)
- ❌ No backend route for settings management
- ❌ Logo upload button had no functionality
- ❌ Potential security issue

## The Solution ✅

### What Was Created

**1. Backend API Route** (`backend/routes/settings.js`)

```
GET    /api/settings              - Get all settings
POST   /api/settings              - Save all settings
GET    /api/settings/:key         - Get specific setting
PUT    /api/settings/:key         - Update specific setting
POST   /api/settings/logo         - Upload logo (file)
DELETE /api/settings/logo         - Delete logo
```

**2. Frontend Updates** (`website/src/admin/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`)

- Changed from Supabase calls → API calls
- Added `handleLogoUpload()` function
- Added `handleDeleteLogo()` function
- Updated UI with working upload/delete buttons
- All settings now save through unified API

**3. Dependencies**

- Added `multer@1.4.5-lts.1` to backend for file handling

**4. Server Integration**

- Updated `backend/server.js` to register settings route
- Route available at `/api/settings`

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket (One-time)

Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Create new bucket:

- Name: `site-assets`
- Type: Private
- Click Create

OR run in Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('site-assets', 'site-assets', false)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install  # Already done
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Admin Settings

1. Open: `http://localhost:5173/admin` (or your dev URL)
2. Go to: Settings → General Settings
3. Try:
   - ✅ Upload logo
   - ✅ Edit company name
   - ✅ Add email/phone
   - ✅ Save settings
   - ✅ Refresh page (should persist)

```
✅ backend/routes/settings.js              (NEW)
✅ backend/server.js                       (UPDATED - added route import & registration)

## 📝 API Usage Examples

**Upload Logo:**

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("logo", fileInput.files[0]);
const res = await fetch("/api/settings/logo", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});
const { logoUrl } = await res.json();
```

**Save Settings:**

```javascript
const res = await fetch('/api/settings', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    general_settings: { siteName, siteEmails, sitePhones, siteAddress, logoUrl },
    social_links: { ... },
    display_settings: { ... }
  })
});
```
