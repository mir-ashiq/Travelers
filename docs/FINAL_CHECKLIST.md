## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK GUIDE

### Problem: "Port already in use"

**Solution**: Change PORT in `.env` or kill the process

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Problem: "Module not found"

**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Problem: "Build fails with TypeScript errors"

**Solution**: Check and fix errors

```bash
npm run type-check
# Fix errors shown, then retry
npm run build
```

### Problem: "Email not sending"

**Solution**: Check backend logs and SMTP config

```bash
# Check logs
cd backend && npm start
# Look for email messages in terminal

# Verify .env
cat backend/.env | grep SMTP
```

### Problem: "Database connection error"

**Solution**: Verify Supabase connection

```bash
# Check SUPABASE_URL and keys in backend/.env
# Verify Supabase project is running
# Check RLS policies if queries fail
```
