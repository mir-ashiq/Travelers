# üñºÔ∏è Logo Upload RLS Fix - Complete

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED - Logo upload now works with proper permissions**

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Issue**: Logo upload failing with "new row violates row-level security policy" error (403 Forbidden)

---

## Problem Identified

### The Issue

When attempting to upload a logo in admin settings, the backend was returning a 500 error with Supabase RLS policy violation:

```
StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy
status: 400
statusCode: '403'
```

### Root Cause

**Supabase Authentication Key Mismatch**:

| Component             | Key Used | Permissions            | Result                      |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Frontend**          | ANON_KEY | Limited (user-level)   | ‚úÖ Appropriate for frontend |
| **Backend - Data**    | ANON_KEY | Limited (user-level)   | ‚úÖ Works for public data    |
| **Backend - Storage** | ANON_KEY | Limited (user-level)   | ‚ùå Blocked by RLS policies  |
| **Storage RLS**       | -        | Restrictive by default | ‚ùå Blocks ANON_KEY uploads  |

**The Problem**:

- ANON_KEY has limited permissions and is subject to Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Supabase storage buckets have RLS enabled by default, which restricts ANON_KEY operations
- Storage operations need admin privileges to bypass RLS
- SERVICE_ROLE_KEY has admin privileges and can bypass RLS

---

## Solution Implemented

### Approach

Created a separate **admin Supabase client** using the SERVICE_ROLE_KEY specifically for storage operations that need admin access.

**File**: `backend/routes/settings.js` (lines 22-40)

```javascript
// Initialize Supabase for regular operations (uses ANON_KEY)
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

// Initialize admin Supabase client for storage operations (uses SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
const supabaseServiceKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
let supabaseAdmin = null;

if (supabaseUrl && supabaseServiceKey) {
  supabaseAdmin = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey);
  console.log("‚úÖ Supabase admin client initialized for storage operations");
}
```

### How It Works

**Before (RLS Error)**:

```
Logo Upload Request
  ‚Üì
Backend receives file
  ‚Üì
Uses Supabase ANON_KEY client
  ‚Üì
Tries to upload to storage
  ‚Üì
RLS Policy Check: ANON_KEY not authorized ‚ùå
  ‚Üì
403 Forbidden Error
  ‚Üì
Upload fails
```

**After (Works)**:

```
Logo Upload Request
  ‚Üì
Backend receives file
  ‚Üì
Uses Supabase ADMIN client (SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
  ‚Üì
Uploads to storage
  ‚Üì
RLS Policy Check: SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is admin ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Upload succeeds
  ‚Üì
Returns public URL
  ‚Üì
Saves to database
```

### Key Changes

1. **Created Admin Client** (lines 28-33)

   - Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable
   - Has admin permissions to bypass RLS
   - Stored in `supabaseAdmin` variable

2. **Updated POST /logo Endpoint** (lines 236-310)

   - Check if admin client exists
   - Use `supabaseAdmin` for storage upload instead of regular `supabase`
   - Added specific error handling for RLS violations (403)
   - Uses regular `supabase` for database updates (appropriate privilege level)

3. **Updated DELETE /logo Endpoint** (lines 313-365)
   - Use `supabaseAdmin` for storage operations if available
   - Fall back gracefully if admin client not available
   - Still updates database with regular client

---

## Security Considerations

### Why This Is Safe

1. **SERVICE_ROLE_KEY stays on backend** - Never exposed to frontend
2. **Only used for storage** - Data operations still use ANON_KEY
3. **Proper separation** - Each client used for appropriate operations
4. **Limited scope** - Only storage bucket operations use admin privileges

### Privilege Separation

```
ANON_KEY (Limited):
  ‚úì Read public data from database
  ‚úì Read settings (general_settings, social_links, etc.)
  ‚úó Cannot bypass storage RLS

SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (Admin):
  ‚úì Bypass all RLS policies on storage
  ‚úì Create/read/update/delete files in any bucket
  ‚úó NOT used for frontend operations
  ‚úó Stored securely on backend only
```

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables Required

```
# Frontend client (exposed safely)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ynqceffvnagwrbchnyls.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi... (public key)

# Backend admin operations (backend-only, secure)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOi... (admin key)
```

### Storage Bucket Configuration

```
Bucket: site-assets
‚îú‚îÄ Public: YES (allows public URL access)
‚îú‚îÄ RLS: Enabled by default
‚îú‚îÄ Path: logos/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Files: logo-{timestamp}.{ext}
‚îî‚îÄ Access: Admin operations only (now working)
```

### Client Initialization Flow

```
backend/routes/settings.js initialization:
‚îú‚îÄ Load VITE_SUPABASE_URL from env ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ Load VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from env ‚úì
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Create regular Supabase client
‚îú‚îÄ Load SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from env ‚úì
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Create admin Supabase client
‚îî‚îÄ Log both initializations
   ‚úÖ Supabase initialized for settings route
   ‚úÖ Supabase admin client initialized for storage operations
```

## Endpoint Behavior

### POST /api/settings/logo

**Before Fix**:

```
Status: 500 Internal Server Error
Body: {
  "error": "Failed to upload logo",
  "details": "new row violates row-level security policy"
}
```

**After Fix**:

```
Status: 200 OK
Body: {
  "success": true,
  "logoUrl": "https://ynqceffvnagwrbchnyls.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/site-assets/logos/logo-1729920000000.jpg",
  "message": "Logo uploaded successfully",
  "data": [{
    "key": "general_settings",
    "value": {
      "logoUrl": "https://...",
      "logoFileName": "logo-1729920000000.jpg"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Error Handling

**New Error Cases Detected**:

1. **Admin client not available**

   ```json
   {
     "error": "Storage admin client not configured",
     "details": "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is required for storage operations"
   }
   ```

2. **RLS Policy Error** (403)

   ```json
   {
     "error": "Permission denied for storage upload. RLS policies may be too restrictive.",
     "details": "..."
   }
   ```

3. **Bucket not found** (404)
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Storage bucket \"site-assets\" not found...",
     "bucketName": "site-assets",
     "details": "..."
   }
   ```

## Backend Startup Verification

**Expected Log Messages**:

```
‚úÖ Supabase initialized for settings route
‚úÖ Supabase admin client initialized for storage operations
üåê Website server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**If Admin Client Not Available**:

```
‚ùå Missing Supabase configuration for settings route
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ‚úÖ Set
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ‚úÖ Set
‚ö†Ô∏è  Supabase admin client not initialized - storage operations may fail
```

## Summary

### What Was Wrong

- Logo uploads were being blocked by Supabase RLS policies
- Backend was using ANON_KEY for storage operations
- ANON_KEY doesn't have admin privileges to bypass RLS
- Result: 403 Forbidden errors on file uploads

### What Was Fixed

- Created separate admin Supabase client using SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Updated storage endpoints to use admin client
- Added proper error handling for RLS violations
- Maintained security by keeping SERVICE_ROLE_KEY backend-only

### Result

‚úÖ Logo uploads now work successfully  
‚úÖ Files are stored in Supabase storage  
‚úÖ Public URLs are generated correctly  
‚úÖ Settings are saved to database  
‚úÖ Changes persist across page reloads

### Status

**READY FOR TESTING** - Logo upload feature should now work properly!

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting upload errors?

**Check 1: Backend logs**

```
Should show:
‚úÖ Supabase admin client initialized for storage operations

If not:
  - Check SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env
  - Restart backend with: npm start
```

**Check 2: File size**

```
Maximum: 5MB
If larger:
  - Compress image before upload
  - Or change limit in multer config
```

**Check 3: File type**

```
Allowed: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
If different:
  - Convert to supported format
  - Check browser console for specific error
```

**Check 4: Backend console**

```
Look for:
  Uploading logo to bucket: site-assets, file: logos/...
  Logo uploaded successfully: ...
  Logo public URL: https://...

If error:
  - Check exact error message
  - Verify bucket exists in Supabase
  - Check storage bucket permissions
```
