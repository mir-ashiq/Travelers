# 🗂️ Storage Bucket Fix - Logo Upload Feature

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - Storage bucket created & configured**  
**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Issue**: Logo upload returning "Bucket not found" error (StorageApiError 404)

---

## Problem

When attempting to upload a logo in the admin settings, the backend was throwing an error:

```
Logo upload error: StorageApiError: Bucket not found
  status: 400,
  statusCode: '404'
```

**Root Cause**: The Supabase storage bucket `'site-assets'` didn't exist. The code referenced it but the bucket was never created in Supabase.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Created Storage Bucket

**Action**: Created the `site-assets` bucket in Supabase storage

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('site-assets', 'site-assets', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

**Result**: ✅ Bucket now exists and is publicly accessible

**Bucket Properties**:

- **ID**: `site-assets`
- **Name**: `site-assets`
- **Public**: `true` (allows public read access to logos)
- **Created**: October 26, 2025

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling

**File**: `backend/routes/settings.js` (POST /logo endpoint, lines ~205-270)

**Improvements**:

- Added bucket name variable for easier configuration
- Added detailed logging of upload process
- Added specific error message for missing bucket
- Return helpful error message if bucket not found
- Log file path and upload details
- Added error details in response

```javascript
const bucketName = "site-assets";
const filePath = `logos/${fileName}`;

console.log(`Uploading logo to bucket: ${bucketName}, file: ${filePath}`);

if (error) {
  console.error("Logo upload error:", error);
  if (
    error.statusCode === "404" ||
    error.message?.includes("Bucket not found")
  ) {
    return res.status(500).json({
      error: `Storage bucket "${bucketName}" not found...`,
      bucketName,
      details: error.message,
    });
  }
  // ... more error handling
}
```

### 3. ✅ Improved Logging

**POST /logo endpoint**:

- Logs bucket name and file path before upload attempt
- Logs successful upload with file info
- Logs public URL generation
- Logs settings update

**DELETE /logo endpoint**:

- Logs bucket name
- Logs file deletion attempt
- Gracefully handles storage deletion errors
- Still succeeds in removing from database even if storage delete fails

## Technical Details

### Storage Bucket Structure

```
site-assets/
└── logos/
    ├── logo-1729918234567.jpg
    ├── logo-1729918291234.png
    └── ... (new uploads)
```

### File Upload Flow

```
1. User uploads logo in admin settings
2. Multer intercepts and validates file
3. POST /api/settings/logo receives file
4. Generates filename: logo-{timestamp}.{ext}
5. Uploads to: site-assets/logos/{filename}
6. Gets public URL from Supabase
7. Saves URL to site_settings table (general_settings key)
8. Returns success with logo URL
```

### API Response - Success

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "logoUrl": "https://ynqceffvnagwrbchnyls.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/site-assets/logos/logo-1729918234567.jpg",
  "message": "Logo uploaded successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "key": "general_settings",
      "value": {
        "logoUrl": "https://...",
        "logoFileName": "logo-1729918234567.jpg"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### API Response - Error (Bucket not found)

```json
{
  "error": "Storage bucket \"site-assets\" not found. Please ensure the bucket exists in Supabase Storage.",
  "bucketName": "site-assets",
  "details": "Error message from Supabase"
}
```

## Configuration

### Backend Changes

**File**: `backend/routes/settings.js`

**Changes Made**:

1. Line ~208: Added `const bucketName = 'site-assets';`
2. Line ~209: Added `const filePath = 'logos/' + fileName;`
3. Lines ~213-214: Added logging before upload
4. Lines ~225-235: Enhanced error handling with specific checks
5. Lines ~238-240: Added logging after successful upload
6. Lines ~245-246: Added logging for URL generation
7. Lines ~250-258: Better error handling for settings update
8. Lines ~260-263: Return detailed response with data

**Backward Compatibility**: ✅ No breaking changes - only added logging and error details

### Supabase Configuration

**Storage Bucket Created**:

- Name: `site-assets`
- Public: Yes (enables logo CDN delivery)
- Size limit: No limit set (uses default)
- MIME types: All allowed (validated by multer on backend)

---

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Test Verification

- [x] Supabase storage bucket created: `site-assets`
- [x] Bucket is public (for CDN access)
- [x] Backend code updated with better logging
- [x] Error handling improved for missing bucket
- [x] Backend restarted with new code

### Test Cases

**Test 1: Upload Valid Logo**

```
Action: Upload JPG/PNG to admin settings
Expected:
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Response contains logoUrl
  - Image displays in preview
  - URL is public and accessible
  - File stored in site-assets/logos/
Result: [ ] Pass
```

**Test 2: Verify Logo Persists**

```
Action: Reload settings page
Expected:
  - Logo still displays
  - URL saved in database
  - Same URL returned from API
Result: [ ] Pass
```

**Test 3: Delete Logo**

```
Action: Delete logo from settings
Expected:
  - Logo removed from display
  - File deleted from storage
  - URL removed from database
  - Response shows success
Result: [ ] Pass
```

**Test 4: Invalid File Type**

```

  - Error message returned
  - No file stored
Result: [ ] Pass
```

**Test 5: File Size Limit**

```
Action: Try uploading file > 5MB
Expected:
  - Multer rejects file
  - Error message about size
  - No upload attempted

## Files Modified

### `backend/routes/settings.js`

**Lines Modified**: ~60 lines in POST /logo endpoint, ~50 lines in DELETE /logo endpoint

**Changes**:

```diff
+ const bucketName = 'site-assets';
+ const filePath = `logos/${fileName}`;
+ console.log(`Uploading logo to bucket: ${bucketName}, file: ${filePath}`);
+ if (error.statusCode === '404' || error.message?.includes('Bucket not found')) {
+   return res.status(500).json({
+     error: `Storage bucket "${bucketName}" not found...`,
+     bucketName,
+     details: error.message
+   });
+ }
+ console.log('Logo uploaded successfully:', data);
+ console.log('Logo public URL:', publicUrl);
+ const { data: updateData, error: updateError } = ...

## Next Steps

1. **Test Logo Upload**

   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/settings
   - Try uploading a logo
   - Verify it displays and saves

2. **Monitor Logs**

   - Check backend logs for upload confirmation
   - Look for "Uploading logo to bucket: site-assets"
   - Verify URL is generated correctly

3. **Verify Persistence**

   - Reload page
   - Logo should still be there
   - Check browser Network tab for public URL

4. **Test Delete**
   - Delete the logo
   - Verify it's removed from database
   - Check storage bucket is cleaned up

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting "Bucket not found" error?

1. Verify bucket exists: `mcp_supabase_list_storage_buckets`
2. Check backend restarted: Look for "✅ Supabase initialized"
3. Clear browser cache: May have cached old error
4. Check Supabase credentials in .env

### Logo uploads but doesn't display?

1. Check URL format in database (should be https://...)
2. Verify bucket is public
3. Check browser console for CORS errors
4. Verify file was actually written to storage

### Upload fails with different error?

1. Check file size < 5MB
2. Verify file type is image (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
3. Check backend logs for specific error message
4. Verify Supabase database permissions
