# üîí BOOKING DELETE PERMISSION - Complete Fix (Oct 25, 2025)

## Your Issues

1. ‚ùå **Support users CAN delete bookings** (permission not enforced)
2. ‚ùå **Admin deletion shows deleted but reappears after refresh** (not persisting)

---

## Root Cause

Frontend was calling **Supabase directly** for deletion:

```javascript
await supabase.from("bookings").delete().in("id", selectedBookings);
```

This **bypassed all backend permission checks**!

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend: Added DELETE Endpoints

**File:** `backend/routes/bookings.js`

Added two new endpoints with permission checking:

```javascript
// Single booking delete
DELETE /api/bookings/:id
  ‚úì Checks: bookings_delete permission (Admin only)
  ‚úì Returns: 403 Forbidden if no permission

// Bulk booking delete
POST /api/bookings/bulk-delete
  ‚úì Body: { ids: [1, 2, 3, ...] }
  ‚úì Checks: bookings_delete permission (Admin only)
  ‚úì Returns: 403 Forbidden if no permission
```

### 2. Frontend: Updated to Use Backend

**File:** `website/src/admin/bookings/BookingsPage.tsx`

Changed `bulkDeleteBookings()` function:

**Before (‚ùå):**

```javascript
// Direct Supabase - no permission check
const { error } = await supabase
  .from("bookings")
  .delete()
  .in("id", selectedBookings);
```

**After (‚úÖ):**

```javascript
// Backend API - with permission check
const token = localStorage.getItem("authToken");
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/bulk-delete", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ids: selectedBookings }),
});

// Permission denied response
if (response.status === 403) {
  toast.error("You do not have permission to delete bookings");
  return;
}
```

## Permission Results

| User Role | bookings_delete | Can Delete | Result          |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Admin     | ‚úÖ true         | YES        | Booking deleted |
| Manager   | ‚ùå false        | NO         | 403 Forbidden   |
| Support   | ‚ùå false        | NO         | 403 Forbidden   |
| Guide     | ‚ùå false        | NO         | 403 Forbidden   |

## How It Works Now

### Admin Flow (Works ‚úÖ)

```
Admin clicks Delete
  ‚Üì
Frontend calls: POST /api/bookings/bulk-delete with JWT
  ‚Üì
Backend middleware verifies JWT
  ‚Üì
Backend checks: Admin role has bookings_delete? YES ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Backend deletes booking via Supabase
  ‚Üì
Success response returned
  ‚Üì
Frontend updates UI (booking removed)
  ‚Üì
Page refresh: Booking is still gone ‚úÖ
```

### Support Flow (Now Blocked ‚úÖ)

```
Support clicks Delete
  ‚Üì
Frontend calls: POST /api/bookings/bulk-delete with JWT
  ‚Üì
Backend middleware verifies JWT
  ‚Üì
Backend checks: Support role has bookings_delete? NO ‚ùå
  ‚Üì
Backend returns: 403 Forbidden
  ‚Üì
Frontend shows: "You do not have permission to delete bookings"
  ‚Üì
Booking NOT deleted ‚úÖ SECURE!
```

## Testing

```bash
# Test 1: Admin Can Delete
1. Login as Admin
2. Select a booking
3. Click Delete
4. Confirm deletion
5. Should see success message ‚úÖ
6. Refresh page
7. Booking should be gone ‚úÖ

# Test 2: Support Cannot Delete
1. Login as Support
2. Select a booking
3. Try to click Delete
4. Should see: "Permission Denied" error ‚úÖ
5. Booking should NOT be deleted ‚úÖ

# Test 3: Manager Cannot Delete
1. Login as Manager
2. Select a booking
3. Try to click Delete
4. Should see: "Permission Denied" error ‚úÖ
```

## Files Changed

| File                                          | Changes                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `backend/routes/bookings.js`                  | ‚úÖ Added DELETE and POST /bulk-delete endpoints    |
| `website/src/admin/bookings/BookingsPage.tsx` | ‚úÖ Updated bulkDeleteBookings() to use backend API |

---

## Security Improvements

‚úÖ **No Direct Supabase Calls** - All deletes go through backend  
‚úÖ **JWT Verification** - Every request must have valid token  
‚úÖ **Permission Enforcement** - Backend checks role permissions  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Server logs show who deleted what  
‚úÖ **Error Messages** - Clear permission denied messages
