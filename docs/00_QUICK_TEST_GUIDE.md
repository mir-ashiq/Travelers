## 🆘 If Tests Fail

### Error: 404 on /api/settings

- [ ] Verify backend is still running
- [ ] Check: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
- [ ] Verify catch-all route fix in server.js

### Error: HTML response instead of JSON

- [ ] Refresh page with Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- [ ] Check if old process running: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
- [ ] Restart backend: `cd backend; npm start`

### Error: "Database connection not configured"

- [ ] Check .env has VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- [ ] Verify value matches Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Restart backend for env changes to take effect

### Error: Settings don't load

- [ ] Check Supabase has site_settings table
- [ ] Verify table has public read access (RLS)
- [ ] Check browser console for fetch errors
