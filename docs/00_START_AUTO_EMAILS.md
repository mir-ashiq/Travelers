# Edit with your SMTP credentials
```

### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Step 3: Deploy

git push heroku main

# Railway
# Just connect GitHub repo

# Your Server
npm start
```

## WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY

### When Website Uploads

1. Server runs `npm start`
2. App builds
3. Express server starts
4. Email service starts
5. Both run 24/7

### When User Books

1. Frontend calls email function
2. Email queued to database (instant)
3. User sees success (no wait)
4. Service sends email (in background)
5. Email arrives in inbox

### Every 30 Seconds

1. Service checks database for pending emails
2. Sends any pending emails via SMTP
3. Updates status in database
4. Loops forever
