## 📝 Optional Configuration

### Add Notes to Contacts (For Customers)

Currently, contacts display as simple numbers/emails. If you want to add labels like "(Bookings)" or "(Support)"):

**Option 1: Manual (Recommended)**

```
In admin, change:
  bookings@jklgtravel.com
to:
  Bookings: bookings@jklgtravel.com

This gives users context about which email to use
```

**Option 2: Code Enhancement (For developers)**

```
Update Footer to display with custom labels:
siteEmails = [
  { email: "info@jklgtravel.com", label: "General" },
  { email: "bookings@jklgtravel.com", label: "Bookings" },
  { email: "support@jklgtravel.com", label: "Support" }
]

Display: "📧 Bookings: bookings@jklgtravel.com"
```

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### 1. **Booking Emails**

Currently uses first email. To distribute:

```javascript
// In booking confirmation logic
const emailTouches = settings.general.siteEmails;

// Send to primary email
sendEmail(emailTouches[0], bookingConfirmation);

// Or send to all for backup
emailTouches.forEach((email) => {
  sendEmail(email, bookingConfirmation);
});
```

### 2. **Contact Form Routing**

```javascript
// Route contact form to first email
const supportEmail = settings.general.siteEmails[0];

// Or route by category
if (formData.type === "booking") {
  sendEmail(settings.general.siteEmails[1]); // Bookings email
} else if (formData.type === "support") {
  sendEmail(settings.general.siteEmails[2]); // Support email
}
```

### 3. **Admin Notifications**

```javascript
// Notify all emails when new booking
settings.general.siteEmails.forEach((email) => {
  sendAdminNotification(email, newBooking);
});
```
