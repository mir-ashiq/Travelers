# 🎯 ACTION REQUIRED - Email Duplicate Fix

## Current Status

✅ **Backend code is ready** - `email-sender.js` updated with atomic locking

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Update Database (5 minutes)

Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor and run:

```sql
ALTER TABLE email_history
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS email_history_status_check;

ALTER TABLE email_history
ADD CONSTRAINT email_history_status_check
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'sent', 'failed'));
```

**Verify:** Run this to confirm:

```sql
SELECT check_clause FROM information_schema.check_constraints
WHERE table_name = 'email_history';
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend

```bash
# In backend folder
node server.js
```

### Step 3: Test

Create a booking → Check that email is sent **exactly ONE time** (not twice)

## What Changed

### Before (Buggy)

```
Email queued
↓
Service reads: pending ❌
↓
Service sends ✅
↓
Status updates → sent
   BUT...
↓
Next cycle reads SAME email (still pending! ❌)
↓
Sends AGAIN! ❌❌ DUPLICATE!
```

### After (Fixed)

```
Email queued
↓
Service locks: pending → processing (atomic) ✅
↓
Service sends ✅
↓
Status updates → sent
↓
Next cycle: Only finds pending (this one is processing) ✅
↓
No duplicates! ✅✅
```

| Problem                   | Solution                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Still getting 2 emails    | Database constraint not updated - check Step 1 |
| Service crashes           | Already fixed - cleanup will recover ✅        |
| Emails not sending        | Check SMTP is configured                       |
