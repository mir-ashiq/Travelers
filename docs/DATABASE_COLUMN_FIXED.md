# üîß ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED - REASSIGN BOOKING

## The Real Problem ‚ùå

The `assigned_to` column **did not exist** in the database!

**What happened:**

1. Migration file mentioned the column in code examples
2. But the column was **never actually created** in the database
3. Frontend tried to update non-existent column
4. Supabase returned: "Could not find the 'assigned_to' column in the schema cache"

## The Solution ‚úÖ

Created and applied the missing database column via Supabase migration.

---

## What Was Applied

### Migration: `add_assigned_to_bookings`

**SQL Applied:**

```sql
-- Add assigned_to column to bookings table
ALTER TABLE public.bookings
ADD COLUMN assigned_to TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.bookings.assigned_to IS 'Team member assigned to handle this booking';

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_assigned_to ON public.bookings(assigned_to);
```

**What This Does:**

1. ‚úÖ Adds `assigned_to` column to bookings table
2. ‚úÖ Defaults to NULL (no assignment yet)
3. ‚úÖ Creates index for performance
4. ‚úÖ Adds documentation comment

**Result:** Column now exists and is queryable!

## Database Status

### Before Migration ‚ùå

```
Bookings table columns:
- id
- name
- email
- phone
- package
- travel_date
- booking_date
- amount
- status
- message
- payment_status
- source
- created_at
[NO assigned_to]
```

### After Migration ‚úÖ

```
Bookings table columns:
- id
- name
- email
- phone
- package
- travel_date
- booking_date
- amount
- status
- message
- payment_status
- source
- created_at
- assigned_to [NEW!]
```

---

## Impact

### Backend API (Already Created)

- `backend/routes/bookings.js` is now fully functional
- POST `/api/bookings/assign` will now work
- No more "column not found" errors

### Frontend (Already Updated)

- `website/src/admin/bookings/BookingsPage.tsx` is ready
- `assignBooking()` function will now succeed
- Dropdown reassign feature will work

### Combined Flow

```
1. Frontend: User clicks "Reassign"
2. Frontend: Selects team member
3. Frontend: Calls POST /api/bookings/assign
4. Backend: Receives request
5. Backend: Calls Supabase update
6. Supabase: NOW FINDS the assigned_to column ‚úÖ
7. Database: Updates booking
8. Response: Success
9. Frontend: Shows "Booking assigned to [Name]" ‚úÖ
```

---

## Why This Happened

The original schema migration file (`20250605130810_shy_thunder.sql`) defined the bookings table but the `assigned_to` column was referenced in code examples but never included in the actual CREATE TABLE statement.

**Missing from original migration:**

```sql
assigned_to TEXT,
```

**Now fixed** by applying the new migration that adds the column.
