# 🚀 NEXT STEPS - REASSIGN BOOKING FIX

## What's Been Done ✅

1. ✅ Identified root cause: Supabase schema cache issue
2. ✅ Created backend API route for bookings
3. ✅ Updated server to register new route
4. ✅ Modified frontend to use new API
5. ✅ All code validated (no errors)
6. ✅ Documentation created

## What You Need to Do 📋

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server

```bash
# Terminal in backend folder
cd backend
npm run start
```

You should see:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         🚀 JKLG Travel Agency Production Server       ║
║                                                        ║
║  Website: http://localhost:3000                       ║
║  Email Service: Running automatically                 ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Step 2: Reload Frontend

- If dev server already running (Vite on port 5174)
- Refresh browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Should pick up changes automatically via HMR

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Open Admin Panel → Bookings
2. **Click on any booking** to expand modal
3. **Click "Reassign" button**
4. **Select a team member** from dropdown
5. **Expected Result:**
   - Toast: "Booking assigned to [Name]"
   - Modal updates to show assignee
   - Booking list shows updated assignee

### Step 4: Verify in Console

1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Click Reassign and select member
4. Look for POST request: `localhost:3000/api/bookings/assign`
5. Status should be: **200** ✅

### Step 5: Confirm in Backend Console

Backend should show:

```
✅ Booking 24 assigned to: Zara Khan
```

---

## If It Works ✅

Great! The feature is now fixed. All 4 booking features work:

- Send Reminder Email ✅
- Download Invoice ✅
- Generate Invoice ✅
- Reassign to Team Member ✅ (NOW FIXED)

## If It Doesn't Work ❌

### Check Backend is Running

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Should return JSON with status: "ok"

### Check API Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": 1, "assigned_to": "Test"}'
```

### Check Browser Console for Errors

- F12 → Console tab
- Look for red errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests

### Check Supabase Connection

- Verify `.env` has correct keys
- Check Supabase dashboard that bookings table exists
- Verify `assigned_to` column exists

## Files to Watch

If you need to modify later:

1. **Backend API Logic:**

   - `backend/routes/bookings.js`
   - Edit the `assignBooking` logic here

2. **Frontend UI:**

   - `website/src/admin/bookings/BookingsPage.tsx`
   - Lines 1190-1210 (reassign dropdown)
   - Line 1205 (assignBooking call)

3. **Server Configuration:**
   - `backend/server.js`
   - Lines 20, 105 (bookings route)

---

## Environment Variables to Verify

In `backend/.env` (or Vercel/Railway):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ynqceffvnagwrbchnyls.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc... (must be set)
```

Both must be present for backend API to work!
