## 📧 Email Flows Implemented

### 1️⃣ Package Booking Flow

**URL**: PackageDetailPage (public)  
**Trigger**: User submits booking form  
**Queue Process**:

- Frontend calls `sendBookingConfirmationEmail()`
- Email queued to `email_history` table with status='pending'
- `email-sender.js` service processes and sends
- Status updated to 'sent' or 'failed'

**Database**: Creates entry in `bookings` & `email_history` tables  
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Email saved to queue (verified)

### 2️⃣ Booking Status Change Flow

**URL**: Admin Bookings (protected)  
**Trigger**: Admin changes booking status  
**Queue Process**:

- Admin updates status (Confirmed/Cancelled/etc)
- Frontend calls `sendStatusUpdateEmail()`
- Email queued to `email_history` table with status='pending'
- `email-sender.js` service processes and sends
- Status updated to 'sent' or 'failed'

**Database**: Updates `bookings` table & creates `email_history` entry  
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Email saved to queue (verified)

### 3️⃣ Bulk Status Update Flow

**URL**: Admin Bookings (protected)  
**Trigger**: Admin bulk updates multiple bookings  
**Queue Process**:

- Admin selects multiple bookings & new status
- Frontend creates individual emails for each customer
- All emails queued to `email_history` table
- `email-sender.js` processes all (max 10 per run)
- Each status updated individually

**Database**: Updates multiple `bookings` & creates multiple `email_history` entries  
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Emails saved to queue (verified)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

**New Database Queue Architecture** ✅

```
User Action
   ↓
Frontend Component (React)
   ↓
emailService.sendBookingEmail() or sendStatusUpdateEmail()
   ↓
INSERT INTO email_history (status='pending')
   ↓
email-sender.js service (Node.js)
   ↓
Read from email_history WHERE status='pending'
   ↓
Send via SMTP to mail.abctravels.site:587
   ↓
UPDATE email_history SET status='sent'/'failed'
   ↓
Email delivered to customer inbox
```

### Frontend Architecture

```typescript
// src/lib/emailService.ts
export async function sendBookingEmail(payload) {
  const {
    recipient_email,
    recipient_name,
    subject,
    body,
    email_type,
    related_id,
  } = payload;

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from("email_history")
    .insert([
      {
        recipient_email,
        recipient_name,
        subject,
        body,
        email_type,
        related_to: "booking",
        related_id,
        status: "pending", // ← Queued for processing
      },
    ])
    .select();

  if (!error) console.log("Email saved to email_history table:", data);
  return data;
}
```

### Backend Email Sender Service

**email-sender.js** (Node.js):

- ✅ Reads from `email_history` WHERE status='pending'
- ✅ Sends via Nodemailer to SMTP server
- ✅ Updates status to 'sent' on success + stores message_id
- ✅ Updates status to 'failed' on error + stores error_message
- ✅ Processes max 10 emails per run
- ✅ Runs continuously (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ Handles connection verification before sending
- ✅ Full error handling and retry logic

### Database Integration

- ✅ `email_history` - All queued & sent emails
- ✅ `bookings` - Customer bookings with references
- ✅ `site_settings` - SMTP configuration stored
- ✅ No email_templates table needed (templates in code)
- ✅ PostgreSQL reliability + audit trail

- Booking ID 23 created successfully
- Email ID 3 saved to queue: "Email saved to email_history table: [{id: 3, recipient_email: 'imseldrith@gmail.com', ...}]"
- Ready for email-sender service to process

### Test Procedure: Send First Email

**Prerequisites**:

```bash
npm install nodemailer @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Step 1: Create .env file**

SMTP_HOST=mail.abctravels.site
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=[your email address]
SMTP_PASSWORD=[your email password]
SMTP_FROM=noreply@abctravels.site
```

**Step 2: Run Email Sender Service**

```bash
node email-sender.js
```

**Expected Output**:

```
📧 Processing pending emails...
✅ Email sent: [message_id]
Updated email_history ID 3 to sent status
```

**Step 3: Verify**

- Check inbox for "Booking Confirmation - Ladakh Adventure" email
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM email_history WHERE id = 3;`
- Verify status='sent' and message_id is populated

### Test Procedure: New Booking Email

- Navigate to package detail page
- Fill booking form with test data
- Click "Book Now"
- Observe console: "Booking created successfully with ID: XX"
- Observe console: "Email saved to email_history table: [{...}]"

**Step 2: Send Pending Email**

```bash
node email-sender.js
```

**Step 3: Verify**

- Check inbox for booking confirmation
- Verify database has 'sent' status
- Check message_id is stored

### Test Procedure: Status Update Email

**Step 1: Admin Status Change**

- Navigate to Admin → Bookings
- Select any pending booking
- Change status to "Confirmed"
- Observe console: "Email saved to email_history table: [{...}]"

**Step 2: Send Pending Email**

```bash
node email-sender.js
```

**Step 3: Verify**

- Check customer inbox for status update
- Verify database has 'sent' status

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- View pending emails
SELECT id, recipient_email, subject, status, created_at
FROM email_history
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View sent emails
SELECT id, recipient_email, subject, status, message_id, sent_at
FROM email_history
WHERE status = 'sent'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC;

-- View failed emails
SELECT id, recipient_email, subject, status, error_message
FROM email_history
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- All emails for a booking
SELECT * FROM email_history
WHERE related_to = 'booking' AND related_id = 23
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
